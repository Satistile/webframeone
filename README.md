## About us:
web:frameone is a little CSS Framework that have a modern design and is easy to use. The whole Framework is developed by a german developer called Satistile. All properties of this Framework are optimized to work perfectly with a Font called Inter. But more about that topic is in the documentation. The Framework will work with other fonts, but perhaps it doesn't fit as anticipated. We hope, web:frameone is helpful.
